    <h3>About me</h3>

        <p>My name is Tabatha McGee. I was born and raised in Atlanta, Georgia. I am a Veteran of the U.S. Army, where I served for seven years.
         I have a service dog named Gabe, and I could not live without him. I love gardening. I have my own garden in my backyard and it is a rather
         large garden.</p>

        <p> My family is the wind beneath my wings.My father's name is Collins McGee, Jr. (deceased), and my mother's name is Jeanette W. McGee.
         I have three siblings. Collins, Chauncey, and Miriam. I have 4 children LaKenyatta, Melvin (deceased), Collins and KeVaughn. </p>

         <p>I have six nephews, Zak, Zion, Derrick, Adrian, Chancellor, and Chauncey Jr., and two nieces, Ashli and Amiya. I have nine grandchildren Khloe,
         Seven, Zaiden, August, Nyla, Aiden, Caleb, King, and Alliyah.</p>

         <p>My main squeeze is Gregory Hardy. We have been dating for four years and have known each other since high school. Funny how this occurred.</p>

         <p>I recently was promoted to CEO of the Sickle Cell Foundation of Georgia, Inc. It has been a rewarding experience.
         However, I got promoted after starting Mercer Univesity. Therefore, I have had a hectic few months.</p>

         <p>I started Mercer University on August 23, 2021, and I somehow managed to maintain all A's, which put me on the President's List.
         I am majoring in Software Application Development & Human-Computer Interaction with a Minor in Business Administration.
         My goal is to obtain my doctorate in Technology & Innovation Management.</p>
